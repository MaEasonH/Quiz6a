1. Generate Simulated Data
```{r}
set.seed(123)

hours <- 1:8
employee_1 <- round(rnorm(8, mean=10, sd=3))  # Employee 1 customers served
employee_2 <- employee_1 + round(rnorm(8, sd=2))  # Employee 2, positively correlated with some variation

data <- data.frame(hour=hours, employee_1=employee_1, employee_2=employee_2)
print(data)
```

2.min value
```{r}
min(data) == 4
```
3. Correlation Test
```{r}

cor.test(data$employee_1, data$employee_2)
```
4. Plotting the Data
```{r}
plot(data$employee_1, data$employee_2, main="Correlation between Employee Efficiencies",
     xlab="Employee 1 Customers Served", ylab="Employee 2 Customers Served", pch=19, col="blue")
```
5. Linear Regression Analysis
```{r}
model <- lm(employee_2 ~ employee_1, data=data)
summary(model)
```
